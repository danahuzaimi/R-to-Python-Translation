# R to Python Translation 

This repository contains files where I have translated a script from R to Python.

## Project Description

The original R script performed by Sepideh Foroutan, PhD. to screen and optimise potential drug compunds. This excercise served as a hands-on method to deepen my understanding of both languages, particularly the syntax and libraries used for data visualization for bioinformatics analysis.

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- csv
- os
  
## Disclaimer 
To maintain the confidentiality of the project, only selective examples of figures and scripts have been shared. Sensitive details have either been excluded or anonymized.
